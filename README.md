# MinHash Algorithm for Sales Transactions

Today, data is growing rapidly in the information society. An incredible amount of structured and unstructured data is generated every day from social networks, financial industries, medical devices and digital equipment and similar tools. In the age of technology, one of the areas where the biggest data is formed is e-commerce. With the development of technology in recent years, e-commerce plays an important role in supporting the development of businesses. Thanks to e-commerce, businesses can access and establish a wider market presence by providing cheaper and more efficient distribution channels for their products or services.

In this study, it is aimed to find the similarities between the customers by creating MinHash signatures of the product information of the customers by using the data set of one-year sales transaction of the UK-based e-commerce (online retail).

# Dataset

The dataset used in the study was taken from Kaggle (Ramos, 2018). The dataset used in the study contains information about the one-year sales process of the UK-based e-commerce (online retail). This London-based store has been selling gifts and household items for adults and children through its website since 2007. This store has customers from all over the world and often shop directly for themselves. Small businesses that buy in bulk and sell to other customers through retail channels are also included in the dataset.
